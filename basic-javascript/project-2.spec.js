// start testing!//toBe is ===,  Object.is() is strict equality except for how it treats NAN and +0/-0 not == no type coercion, referential equality for objects, toEqual deep comparison, toContain, not toHaveLength
//toEqual recursively checks every field of an object or array.
//If both operands are objects, then JavaScript compares internal references 
/*=== is called strict comparison operator in JavaScript. Object.is and strict comparison operator behave exactly the same except for NaN and +0/-0.*/

//to Equal checks the deep equality, recursively passing through the properties, === strict or abstract == is never true comparing different object instances



// whoops.. there is no test suite for this file. You'll simply just have to create one :/



//what is the unit under test
//what should it do 
//what was the expected output
//how do you reproduce the failure (given)(should)
